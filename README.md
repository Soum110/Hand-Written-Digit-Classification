# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification
Creating a project which can classify Hand Written Digits into 10 classes (from 0-9) as per the hand written values.
The model is implemented using neural network and the dataset used in this project is MNIST dataset.
</br>
# Implementation Process:
1. Load the MNIST dataset using Tensorflow
2. Build a simple neural network model.
3. Train model on training data.
4. Test modelon test data to see accuracy.
5. Predicts some sample digits
</br>
# Forward pass configuration:
1. Input_layer => 784 (28*28) grayscale neurons
2. Hidden_layer1 => 16 neurons
3. Hideen_layer2 => 16 neurons
4. Output_layer => 10 neurons (0-9)
</br>
# Training Configuration:
1. Optimizer => Adam
2. Loss Calculation => Categorical Cross Entropy
3. Metrics => Accuracy
